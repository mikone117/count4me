Count 4 me :date:
============

### what?

Just a countdown timer for the next June 26 (2017). A simple and clean site.

### why?

Next June 27, 2017 is my deadline to present my degree final project :notebook: and i did feel like make a constant reminder. Just for fun.

### How?

[Here](https:mikone117.github.io) you can find this project repository and you can do whatever you want. :wink:.

**[Tip:]** Change the variable ``target_date`` in ``js/file`` file.
